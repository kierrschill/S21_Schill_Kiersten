# Naming your Repo

Use this template repo to create your own repository in this organization.    
Please name your repo `[semester][yeartwodigits]_[lastname]_[firstname]`.  For example s21_hathaway_j

- Spring = S
- Fall = F
- Winter = W

# Blank Project Template

A blank project repository for folder structure and naming guidance.  The `confidentiality_agreement.md` can be used if you are working with a client.  Please make sure to create a private repo for client work.

## High-level folders

- `results` - contains the deliverables from the project.
- `scripts` - contains the final scripts that built the items in the `results` folder.  Each script should be concise and mapped to the deliverables in the `results` folder.
- `data` has files that are smaller than 100mb provided by the client and built by you.  Note that a `big_data` folder can be created in the repository and that it will be ignored for data larger than 100mb.
- `references` contains a folder for the project proposal and any other `reference_material.`
